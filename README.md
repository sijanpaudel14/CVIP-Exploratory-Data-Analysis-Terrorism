# CVIP-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Terrorism
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns.By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover
trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal
factors that contribute to terrorist activities.
